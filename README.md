# Demand-Forecasting-using-Linear-Regression

Problem Statement : 

One of the largest retail chains in the world wants to use their vast data source to build an efficient forecasting model to predict the sales for each SKU in its 
portfolio at its 76 different stores using historical sales data for the past 3 years on a week-on-week basis. Sales and promotional information is also available 
for each week - product and store wise. 

However, no other information regarding stores and products are available. So we need to forecast accurately the sales values for every such product/SKU-store 
combination for the next 12 weeks accurately.


Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric is 100*RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error).
The basic objective is to implement the project with linear regression and comes up with as much accuracy we can
